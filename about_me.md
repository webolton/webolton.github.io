Geoffery Chaucer, _The Parliament of Fouls_, 1.

I started my career in academia, where I studied early medieval lives of saints and English legal history. In 2013, I took a JavaScript course at [UArts](https://www.uarts.edu/) and fell in love with programming. I enjoyed it so much, I made the leap, switched careers, and have been writing software professionally since 2014.

At work right now, I predominantly work with Ruby and Node, but have also written production code up and down the stack, from Java to React.

In my side-projects, I have used everything I know from work, as well as Python and Elixir. I am mostly a Rubyist by trade, but _love_ learning new languages and technologies.

I live in and work in Philadelphia, PA with my talented and lovely wife, [Sara Wachter-Boettcher](http://www.sarawb.com/), and one very large cat. I blog [here](link) and on the Digital South English Legendary at [blog.digitalsel.org](http://blog.digitalsel.org/).
