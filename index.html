<h1>Hi!</h1>

<h2>I am a software engineer based in Philadelphia.</h2>
</br>

<p>I work on the Comcast Cybersecurity team, where I make tools that help other developers keep their projects secure.</p>

<p>I love black coffee, fat cats, and expressive, well-tested, self-documenting code.</p>

<p>I earned my PhD from Arizona State University in English literature, where I focused on early medieval lives of saints and English legal history. I have taught a variety of composition, literature, and linguistics courses and have published and presented on a range of topics in early English and Latin literature.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not working on side-projects, reading, or writing, I build ukuleles in my basement.</p>
