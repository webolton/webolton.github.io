<h1>Hi!</h1>

<h2>I am a software engineer based in Philadelphia.</h2>
</br>

<p>I write software that turns data into meaningful information and valuable services.</p>

<p>I love expressive, well-tested, self-documenting code, and black coffee.</p>

<p>I earned my PhD from Arizona State University in English literature, where I focused on early medieval lives of saints and English legal history. I have taught a variety of composition, literature, and linguistics courses and have published and presented on a range of topics in early English and Latin literature.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not working side-projects, reading, or writing, I build ukuleles in my basement.</p>
